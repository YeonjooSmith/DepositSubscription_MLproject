# Predictive modeling for a bank marketing data set using machine learning algorithms 
## About the project 
This project uses a data set from [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing#). 
There are 20 features that describe about clients, the past and current campaign, and the economy situation at the time of the campain. 
The target is a classifiction variable states if the client subscribed a term deposit.
In order to predict the target, three machine learning algorithms are implemented: 
principal component analysis (PCA), K nearest neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest. 
## Codes
The table of contents for the Jupyter notebook, `codes.ipynb` is saved as `TableofContents.PNG` 

The process followed the data science project steps: 

>loading data

>preprocessing data

>exploratory data analysis

>modeling, in-depth analysis, and performance evaluations

>Comparing results for models

### Note
A class `result` to organize data and results of each ML model then those objects are saved as a dictionary as `result.pickle`. Refer to sections 3 and 4 listed in the table above.

## Non-technical summary of the project
The non-technical summary of the project is saved as `NonTechPresentation.pdf`.
